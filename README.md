Hello-World
===========

A place for all EuRuKoers to meet each other and arrange cool stuff!

**TL;DR** Just have a look at the [issues section](https://github.com/euruko2013/Hello-World/issues). 

We all love github, right? Let's use it for arranging all the fun and cool stuff that we want to do at EuRuKo!
If you have something to ask, an idea to share or something to propose to other people that are going to EuRuKo just start a new issue.
